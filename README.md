- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew, aka @PrimalOrB

- 👀 I’m interested in computer graphics / animation, having studied in college. I continue to work with these technologies and techniques as a hobby, but always have an interest in learning more.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack web development through the University of Toronto: School of Continuing Studies in order to expand my skillset, and open the door to new opportunities. I have an interest in learning new skills, and working with interactive web graphics such as threejs and makerjs. 

- 💞️ At this moment I’m not looking to collaborate on any projects, but once done my courses, I plan to offer my services as a part-time freelance web developer
